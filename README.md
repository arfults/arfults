### Hi I'm Aly! ðŸ‘‹
---

I am a Computer Science graduate from Universidade Paulista in Brazil, with a passion for data and a strong desire to contribute to a forward-thinking company. Throughout my education and 7-year career at Ci&T, a digital transformation company in Brazil, I gained invaluable experience and knowledge in programming languages like Java, .NET, and SQL, as well as expertise in Agile methodology and Scrum. 

Driven by my love for learning and continuous improvement, I made the bold decision to move to the USA 4 years ago to immerse myself in the English language and culture. Now, I am determined to deepen my expertise in data science and analytics, leveraging my background in computer science and my enthusiasm for exploring new technologies and methodologies. 

My goal is to leverage my analytical mindset and technical abilities to make a meaningful impact as a data engineer. I am eager to contribute my problem-solving skills and collaborative spirit to a dynamic team, helping to drive data-driven insights and solutions that propel a company forward.

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am deeply committed to animal welfare. Alongside my two sisters, I co-founded a non-profit organization in Brazil dedicated to rescuing animals in need. We provide them with care and rehabilitation before working tirelessly to find them loving forever homes through adoption. Additionally, we manage an Instagram account called Pata Sem Dono, where we share stories of the animals we rescue and promote adoption initiatives.

When I'm not immersed in my professional pursuits, you can find me staying active and embracing the great outdoors. I'm an avid gym-goer, consistently challenging myself with intense workouts and strength training. The serene beaches of the USA have become my favorite running spots, where I can push myself to new personal bests while enjoying the sights and sounds of nature.

Exploring all that the USA has to offer is another passion of mine. Whether it's discovering new hiking trails, trying out local cuisine, or simply going for leisurely walks, I'm always eager to expand my horizons and soak in the vibrant culture and natural beauty of this country. Continually pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone and try new experiences is what keeps me energized and fulfilled in my personal life.
