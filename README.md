### Hi I'm Aly! ðŸ‘‹
---

I am a Computer Science graduate from Universidade Paulista in Brazil, with a passion for data and a strong desire to contribute to a forward-thinking company. Throughout my 7-year career at Ci&T, a digital transformation company in Brazil, I gained invaluable experience in programming languages, Agile methodology, and Scrum.

Driven by my love for learning, I made the bold decision to move to the USA 4 years ago. Now, I am determined to deepen my expertise in data science and analytics, leveraging my background in computer science and enthusiasm for exploring new technologies.

My goal is to leverage my analytical mindset and technical abilities to make a meaningful impact as a data engineer, contributing my problem-solving skills and collaborative spirit to a dynamic team.

Outside of work, I am deeply committed to animal welfare. Alongside my sisters, I co-founded a non-profit organization in Brazil to rescue and rehome animals in need.

When I'm not working or advocating for animals, you can find me staying active and embracing the great outdoors. I'm an avid gym-goer and runner, and I enjoy exploring the USA through hiking, trying local cuisine, and stepping out of my comfort zone.
