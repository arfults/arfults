### Hi I'm Aly! ðŸ‘‹
---
I am a Computer Science graduate from Universidade Paulista in Brazil, with a passion for data and a strong desire to contribute to a forward-thinking company. Throughout my education and career at Ci&T, a digital transformation company in Brazil, where I worked for seven years, I gained invaluable experience and knowledge. This journey inspired me to further enhance my skills and pursue new challenges.<br/>

Driven by my love for learning and continuous improvement, I made the bold decision to move to the USA to immerse myself in English language and culture. Now, I am determined to deepen my expertise in data science and analytics, leveraging my background in computer science and my enthusiasm for exploring new technologies and methodologies.<br/>

Outside of my professional pursuits, I am deeply committed to animal welfare. Alongside my two sisters, I co-founded a non-profit organization in Brazil dedicated to rescuing animals in need. We provide them with care and rehabilitation before working tirelessly to find them loving forever homes through adoption. Additionally, we manage an Instagram account called Pata Sem Dono, where we share stories of the animals we rescue and promote adoption initiatives.<br/>
